This HW contains

- main.cpp - generating animation and raytracing
- main.hpp - all math for vectors and triangles
- ppmToMP4.py - converts PPMs to video

Known issues:

- I forgot export 1 triangle in icosphere, so there is a hole
- Backface culling is ON, because i wasn't able to export triangles as CRT
- There is a dead pixel on first frame (I'm assuming some divide by infinity or zero may occured)
